They are rather dumped in the garbage, making it more difficult to find and reuse/recycle them. This contibutes to further production of plastic toothbrushes, increasing the volume of this harmful substance. We are promoting one hundred percent eco-friendly products ranging from daily use items (like bamboo toothbrushes & cotton masks) to decorative and artistic articles. By exchanging your plastic product to bamboo/cotton one, you would be contributing to our mission of reducing plastic and saving our environment. Looking forward to your participation in our initiative of saving our environment!! You can checkout our products on our website or contact us."

His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with whatever is available inexpensively at the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines for which The Frying Pan became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural culinary connections."
